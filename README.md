# c256-game

Release 1
---------
Multiple sprites (cars and buses) moving at differents speeds.
Worked out a few issues that result in tearing at the edges.
The frog moves in steps of 32 x 32.

Release 0
---------
This is the start of a very simple game.  I have a set of tiles and one generated sprite.
The joystick0 port is supported as well as the ASWD keys. The repeat rate on the keyboard is slower than SOF, so the object doesn't move as fast.
